"11227809","Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array?","<p>Here is a piece of C++ code that seems very peculiar. For some strange reason, sorting the data miraculously makes the code almost six times faster.</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    // Generate data
    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;
    int data[arraySize];

    for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;

    // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
    std::sort(data, data + arraySize);

    // Test
    clock_t start = clock();
    long long sum = 0;

    for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
    {
        // Primary loop
        for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        {
            if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                sum += data[c];
        }
    }

    double elapsedTime = static_cast&lt;double&gt;(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; elapsedTime &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""sum = "" &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Without <code>std::sort(data, data + arraySize);</code>, the code runs in 11.54 seconds.</li>
<li>With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly. So I tried it in Java.</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Generate data
        int arraySize = 32768;
        int data[] = new int[arraySize];

        Random rnd = new Random(0);
        for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            data[c] = rnd.nextInt() % 256;

        // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
        Arrays.sort(data);

        // Test
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        long sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
        {
            // Primary loop
            for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            {
                if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                    sum += data[c];
            }
        }

        System.out.println((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000000.0);
        System.out.println(""sum = "" + sum);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>With a somewhat similar but less extreme result.</p>

<hr>

<p>My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but then I thought how silly that is because the array was just generated.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is going on?</li>
<li>Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array?</li>
<li>The code is summing up some independent terms, and the order should not matter.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <strong><code>PUT</code></strong> method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied <code>Request-URI</code>. If the <code>Request-URI</code> refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the <code>Request-URI</code> does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.""</p>

Just surround the search terms by quotes, e.g. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%5Bphp%5D%20%22===%22%20vs%20%22==%22""><code>[php] ""=="" vs ""===""</code></a></p>

<p>Given a pile of <code>n</code> pairs of socks, containing <code>2n</code> elements (assume each sock has exactly one matching pair), what is the best way to pair them up efficiently with up to logarithmic extra space? (I believe I can remember that amount of info if needed.)</p>

<p>I will appreciate an answer that addresses the following aspects:</p>

<ul>
<li>A general <em>theoretical</em> solution for a huge number of socks.</li>
<li>The actual number of socks is not that large, I don't believe my spouse and I have more than 30 pairs. (And it is fairly easy to distinguish between my socks and hers; can this be used as well?)</li>
<li>Is it equivalent to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_distinctness_problem"">element distinctness problem</a>?</li>

<p>But what are the differences?</p>

<hr>

<p>Summary from answers and links below:</p>

<ol>
<li>A pointer can be re-assigned any number of times while a reference cannot be re-assigned after binding.</li>
<li>Pointers can point nowhere (<code>NULL</code>), whereas a reference always refers to an object.</li>
<li>You can't take the address of a reference like you can with pointers.</li>
<li>There's no ""reference arithmetic"" (but you can take the address of an object pointed by a reference and do pointer arithmetic on it as in <code>&amp;obj + 5</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>To clarify a misconception:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The C++ standard is very careful to avoid dictating how a compiler may
  implement references, but every C++ compiler implements
  references as pointers. That is, a declaration such as:</em></p>

<pre><code>int &amp;ri = i;
</code></pre>
  
  <p><strong><em>if it's not optimized away entirely</em></strong>, <em>allocates the same amount of storage
  as a pointer, and places the address
  of <code>i</code> into that storage.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>So, a pointer and a reference both use the same amount of memory.</em></strong></p>

<p>As a general rule,</p>

<ul>
<li>Use references in function parameters and return types to provide useful and self-documenting interfaces.</li>
<li>Use pointers for implementing algorithms and data structures.</li>
</ul>

"1711631","Improve INSERT-per-second performance of SQLite?","<p>Optimizing SQLite is tricky. Bulk-insert performance of a C application can vary from 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> We are using SQLite as part of a desktop application. We have large amounts of configuration data stored in XML files that are parsed and loaded into an SQLite database for further processing when the application is initialized. SQLite is ideal for this situation because it's fast, it requires no specialized configuration, and the database is stored on disk as a single file.</p>

<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> <em>Initially I was disappointed with the performance I was seeing.</em> It turns-out that the performance of SQLite can vary significantly (both for bulk-inserts and selects) depending on how the database is configured and how you're using the API. It was not a trivial matter to figure out what all of the options and techniques were, so I thought it prudent to create this community wiki entry to share the results with Stack&nbsp;Overflow readers in order to save others the trouble of the same investigations.</p>

<p><strong>The Experiment:</strong> Rather than simply talking about performance tips in the general sense (i.e. <em>""Use a transaction!""</em>), I thought it best to write some C code and <em>actually measure</em> the impact of various options. We're going to start with some simple data:</p>

<ul>
<li>A 28 MB TAB-delimited text file (approximately 865,000 records) of the <a href=""http://www.toronto.ca/open/datasets/ttc-routes"" rel=""noreferrer"">complete transit schedule for the city of Toronto</a></li>
<li>My test machine is a 3.60 GHz P4 running Windows XP.</li>
<li>The code is compiled with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B#32-bit_versions"" rel=""noreferrer"">Visual C++</a> 2005 as ""Release"" with ""Full Optimization"" (/Ox) and Favor Fast Code (/Ot).</li>
<li>I'm using the SQLite ""Amalgamation"", compiled directly into my test application. The SQLite version I happen to have is a bit older (3.6.7), but I suspect these results will be comparable to the latest release (please leave a comment if you think otherwise).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Let's write some code!</em></p>

<p><strong>The Code:</strong> A simple C program that reads the text file line-by-line, splits the string into values and then will inserts the data into an SQLite database. In this ""baseline"" version of the code, the database is created, but we won't actually insert data:</p>

<h2>The ""Control""</h2>

<p>Running the code as-is doesn't actually perform any database operations, but it will give us an idea of how fast the raw C file I/O and string processing operations are.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 0.94
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great! We can do 920,000 inserts per second, provided we don't actually do any inserts :-)</p>

<hr>

<h2>The ""Worst-Case-Scenario""</h2>

<p>We're going to generate the SQL string using the values read from the file and invoke that SQL operation using sqlite3_exec:</p>

<pre><code>sprintf(sSQL, ""INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s')"", sRT, sBR, sVR, sST, sVI, sDT, sTM);
sqlite3_exec(db, sSQL, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<p>This is going to be slow because the SQL will be compiled into VDBE code for every insert and every insert will happen in its own transaction. <em>How slow?</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 9933.61
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yikes! 2 hours and 45 minutes! That's only <strong>85 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>Using a Transaction</h2>

<p>By default, SQLite will evaluate every INSERT / UPDATE statement within a unique transaction. If performing a large number of inserts, it's advisable to wrap your operation in a transaction:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    ...

}
fclose (pFile);

sqlite3_exec(db, ""END TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 38.03
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's better. Simply wrapping all of our inserts in a single transaction improved our performance to <strong>23,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>Using a Prepared Statement</h2>

<p>Using a transaction was a huge improvement, but recompiling the SQL statement for every insert doesn't make sense if we using the same SQL over-and-over. Let's use <code>sqlite3_prepare_v2</code> to compile our SQL statement once and then bind our parameters to that statement using <code>sqlite3_bind_text</code>:</p>

<pre><code>/* Open input file and import into the database */
cStartClock = clock();

sprintf(sSQL, ""INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, @RT, @BR, @VR, @ST, @VI, @DT, @TM)"");
sqlite3_prepare_v2(db,  sSQL, BUFFER_SIZE, &amp;stmt, &amp;tail);

sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);

    sRT = strtok (sInputBuf, ""\t"");   /* Get Route */
    sBR = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Branch */
    sVR = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Version */
    sST = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Stop Number */
    sVI = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Vehicle */
    sDT = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Date */
    sTM = strtok (NULL, ""\t"");        /* Get Time */

    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, sRT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, sBR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, sVR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, sST, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, sVI, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, sDT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, sTM, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);

    sqlite3_step(stmt);

    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);
    sqlite3_reset(stmt);

    n++;
}
fclose (pFile);

sqlite3_exec(db, ""END TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

printf(""Imported %d records in %4.2f seconds\n"", n, (clock() - cStartClock) / (double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC);

sqlite3_finalize(stmt);
sqlite3_close(db);

return 0;
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 16.27
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice! There's a little bit more code (don't forget to call <code>sqlite3_clear_bindings</code> and <code>sqlite3_reset</code>), but we've more than doubled our performance to <strong>53,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>PRAGMA synchronous = OFF</h2>

<p>By default, SQLite will pause after issuing a OS-level write command. This guarantees that the data is written to the disk. By setting <code>synchronous = OFF</code>, we are instructing SQLite to simply hand-off the data to the OS for writing and then continue. There's a chance that the database file may become corrupted if the computer suffers a catastrophic crash (or power failure) before the data is written to the platter:</p>

<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA synchronous = OFF"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 12.41
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The improvements are now smaller, but we're up to <strong>69,600 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</h2>

<p>Consider storing the rollback journal in memory by evaluating <code>PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</code>. Your transaction will be faster, but if you lose power or your program crashes during a transaction you database could be left in a corrupt state with a partially-completed transaction:</p>

<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 13.50
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A little slower than the previous optimization at <strong>64,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>PRAGMA synchronous = OFF <em>and</em> PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</h2>

<p>Let's combine the previous two optimizations. It's a little more risky (in case of a crash), but we're just importing data (not running a bank):</p>

<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */
sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);
sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA synchronous = OFF"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 12.00
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fantastic! We're able to do <strong>72,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>Using an In-Memory Database</h2>

<p>Just for kicks, let's build upon all of the previous optimizations and redefine the database filename so we're working entirely in RAM:</p>

<pre><code>#define DATABASE "":memory:""
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 10.94
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's not super-practical to store our database in RAM, but it's impressive that we can perform <strong>79,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>

<h2>Refactoring C Code</h2>

<p>Although not specifically an SQLite improvement, I don't like the extra <code>char*</code> assignment operations in the <code>while</code> loop. Let's quickly refactor that code to pass the output of <code>strtok()</code> directly into <code>sqlite3_bind_text()</code>, and let the compiler try to speed things up for us:</p>

<pre><code>pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,""r"");
while (!feof(pFile)) {

    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);

    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, strtok (sInputBuf, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT); /* Get Route */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Branch */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Version */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Stop Number */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Vehicle */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Date */
    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, strtok (NULL, ""\t""), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Time */

    sqlite3_step(stmt);        /* Execute the SQL Statement */
    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);    /* Clear bindings */
    sqlite3_reset(stmt);        /* Reset VDBE */

    n++;
}
fclose (pFile);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note: We are back to using a real database file. In-memory databases are fast, but not necessarily practical</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imported 864913 records in 8.94
  seconds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A slight refactoring to the string processing code used in our parameter binding has allowed us to perform <strong>96,700 inserts per second.</strong> I think it's safe to say that this is <em>plenty fast</em>. As we start to tweak other variables (i.e. page size, index creation, etc.) this will be our benchmark.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Summary (so far)</h2>

<p><em>I hope you're still with me!</em> The reason we started down this road is that bulk-insert performance varies so wildly with SQLite, and it's not always obvious what changes need to be made to speed-up our operation. Using the same compiler (and compiler options), the same version of SQLite and the same data we've optimized our code and our usage of SQLite to go <strong>from a worst-case scenario of 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>CREATE INDEX then INSERT vs. INSERT then CREATE INDEX</h2>

<p>Before we start measuring <code>SELECT</code> performance, we know that we'll be creating indices. It's been suggested in one of the answers below that when doing bulk inserts, it is faster to create the index after the data has been inserted (as opposed to creating the index first then inserting the data). Let's try:</p>

<p><strong>Create Index then Insert Data</strong></p>

<pre><code>sqlite3_exec(db, ""CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);
sqlite3_exec(db, ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);

"2193953","Flash CS4 refuses to let go","<p>I have a Flash project, and it has many source files. I have a fairly heavily-used class, call it Jenine. I recently (and, perhaps, callously) relocated Jenine from one namespace to another. I thought we were ready - I thought it was time. The new Jenine was better in every way - she had lost some code bloat, she had decoupled herself from a few vestigial class relationships, and she had finally come home to the namespace that she had always secretly known in her heart was the one she truly belonged to. She was among her own kind.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Flash would have none of that. Perhaps it had formed an attachment. Perhaps it didn't <em>want</em> Jenine to be decoupled. Either way, it clung to the old, perfect version of Jenine in its memory. It refused to move on. It ignored her (function) calls. It tried to forget her new, public interfaces. Instead, every instance of Jenine that it constructed was always a copy of the old version, down to its classpath:</p>

<pre><code>var jenineInstance:Jenine = new Jenine();
trace( getQualifiedClassName(jenineInstance));
// Should print: com.newnamespace.subspace::Jenine
// Prints: com.oldnamespace.subspace::Jenine
// Ah, young love!
</code></pre>

<p>We fought. I'm not proud of some of the things I said or did. In the end, in a towering fit of rage, I deleted all references of Jenine completely. She was utterly, completely erased from the system. My cursor fell upon the ""Empty Trash"" menu option like the cold lid of a casket.</p>

<p>I don't think Flash ever recovered. To this day it still clings to the memory of Jenine. Her old, imperfect definitions still float through my project like abandoned ghosts. Whenever I force Flash to compile, it still lovingly inserts her into my movie, nestling her definition in amongst the other, living classes, like a small shrine. I wonder if they can see her.</p>

<p>Flash and I don't really talk anymore. I write my code, it compiles it. There's a new girl in town named Summer who looks almost identical to Jenine, as if someone had just copied her source-code wholesale into a new class, but Flash hasn't shown any interest. Most days it just mopes around and writes bad poetry in my comments when it thinks I'm not looking.</p>

<p>I hope no one else has had a similar experience, that this is just a singular, painful ripple in the horrifying dark lagoon that is the Flash code-base. If, by some fluke chance you have, or you have any idea how to erase whatever damn cache the compiler is using, please, please help.</p>

    return a
</code></pre>

<p>Python novices would expect this function to always return a list with only one element: <code>[5]</code>. The result is instead very different, and very astonishing (for a novice):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
[5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
[5, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
[5, 5, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
[5, 5, 5, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
</code></pre>

<p>A manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature, and called it ""a dramatic design flaw"" of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?)</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: </p>

<p>Baczek made an interesting example. Together with most of your comments and Utaal's in particular, I elaborated further:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def a():
...     print(""a executed"")
...     return []
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt;            
&gt;&gt;&gt; def b(x=a()):
...     x.append(5)
...     print(x)
... 
a executed
&gt;&gt;&gt; b()
[5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b()
[5, 5]
</code></pre>

<p>To me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function or ""together"" with it?</p>

<p>Doing the binding inside the function would mean that <code>x</code> is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: the <code>def</code> line would be ""hybrid"" in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time.</p>

<p>The actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition.</p>

"160608","Do a ""git export"" (like ""svn export"")?","<p>I've been wondering whether there is a good ""git export"" solution that creates a copy of a tree without the <code>.git</code> repository directory. There are at least three methods I know of:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>git clone</code> followed by removing the <code>.git</code> repository directory.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-checkout-index.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>git checkout-index</code></a> alludes to this functionality but starts with ""Just read the desired tree into the index..."" which I'm not entirely sure how to do.</li>
<li><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/git-export/"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>git-export</code></a> is a third party script that essentially does a <code>git clone</code> into a temporary location followed by <code>rsync --exclude='.git'</code> into the final destination.</li>
</ol>

<p>None of these solutions really strike me as being satisfactory. The closest one to <code>svn export</code> might be option 1, because both those require the target directory to be empty first. But option 2 seems even better, assuming I can figure out what it means to read a tree into the index.</p>

<p>PS: I am not sure, if this helps:</p>

<p>Disassembly for the first loop basically looks like this (this block is repeated about five times in the full program):</p>

<pre><code>movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [edx+18h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+20h]
movsd       mmword ptr [ecx+20h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [esi+10h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+30h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+30h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [edx+20h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+28h]
movsd       mmword ptr [ecx+28h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [esi+18h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+38h]
</code></pre>

<p>Each loop of the double loop example produces this code (the following block is repeated about three times):</p>

<pre><code>addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+28h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+28h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+20h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+30h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+30h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+28h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+38h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+38h],xmm0
movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [ecx+30h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+40h]
movsd       mmword ptr [eax+40h],xmm0
</code></pre>

<p>The question turned out to be of no relevance, as the behavior severely depends on the sizes of the arrays (n) and the CPU cache. So if there is further interest, I rephrase the question:</p>

<p><strong>Could you provide some solid insight into the details that lead to the different cache behaviors as illustrated by the five regions on the following graph?</strong></p>

<p><strong>It might also be interesting to point out the differences between CPU/cache architectures, by providing a similar graph for these CPUs.</strong></p>

<p>PPS: Here is the full code. It uses <a href=""https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">TBB</a> <code>Tick_Count</code> for higher resolution timing, which can be disabled by not defining the <code>TBB_TIMING</code> Macro:</p>

<p>What I am curious about is that when I replaced <code>pow(a,6)</code> with <code>a*a*a*a*a*a</code> using GCC 4.5.1 and options ""<code>-O3 -lm -funroll-loops -msse4</code>"", it uses 5 <code>mulsd</code> instructions:</p>

<p><strong>If you have anything to add, please do</strong></p>

<p>Many systems are dependent on keeping accurate time, the problem is with changes to time due to daylight savings - moving the clock forward or backwards.</p>

<p>For instance, one has business rules in an order taking system that depend on the time of the order - if the clock changes, the rules might not be as clear. How should the time of the order be persisted? There are of course an endless number of scenarios - this one is simply an illustrative one.</p>

<li>What assumptions are part of your solution? (looking for context here)</li>

You merge similar tiles by moving them in any of the four directions to make ""bigger"" tiles. After each move, a new tile appears at random empty position with a value of either <code>2</code> or <code>4</code>. The game terminates when all the boxes are filled and there are no moves that can merge tiles, or you create a tile with a value of <code>2048</code>.</p>

<p>One, I need to follow a well-defined strategy to reach the goal. So, I thought of writing a program for it.</p>

<p>My current algorithm:</p>

<pre><code>while (!game_over) {
    for each possible move:
        count_no_of_merges_for_2-tiles and 4-tiles
    choose the move with a large number of merges
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I am doing is at any point, I will try to merge the tiles with values <code>2</code> and <code>4</code>, that is, I try to have <code>2</code> and <code>4</code> tiles, as minimum as possible. If I try it this way, all other tiles were automatically getting merged and the strategy seems good.</p>

<p>But, when I actually use this algorithm, I only get around 4000 points before the game terminates. Maximum points AFAIK is slightly more than 20,000 points which is way larger than my current score. Is there a better algorithm than the above?</p>

"10057671","How does PHP 'foreach' actually work?","<p>Let me prefix this by saying that I know what <code>foreach</code> is, does and how to use it. This question concerns how it works under the bonnet, and I don't want any answers along the lines of ""this is how you loop an array with <code>foreach</code>"".</p>

<hr>

<p>For a long time I assumed that <code>foreach</code> worked with the array itself. Then I found many references to the fact that it works with a <em>copy</em> of the array, and I have since assumed this to be the end of the story. But I recently got into a discussion on the matter, and after a little experimentation found that this was not in fact 100% true.</p>

<p>Let me show what I mean. For the following test cases, we will be working with the following array:</p>

<pre><code>$array = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://codepad.org/7DIeObk9"" rel=""noreferrer"">Test case 1</a>:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($array as $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  $array[] = $item;
}
print_r($array);

/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5
   $array after loop: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 */
</code></pre>

<p>This clearly shows that we are not working directly with the source array - otherwise the loop would continue forever, since we are constantly pushing items onto the array during the loop. But just to be sure this is the case:</p>

<p><a href=""http://codepad.org/nirz6Ufh"" rel=""noreferrer"">Test case 2</a>:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  $array[$key + 1] = $item + 2;
  echo ""$item\n"";
}

print_r($array);

/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5
   $array after loop: 1 3 4 5 6 7 */
</code></pre>

<p>This backs up our initial conclusion, we are working with a copy of the source array during the loop, otherwise we would see the modified values during the loop. <em>But...</em></p>

<p>If we look in the <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">manual</a>, we find this statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When foreach first starts executing, the internal array pointer is automatically reset to the first element of the array.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right... this seems to suggest that <code>foreach</code> relies on the array pointer of the source array. But we've just proved that we're <em>not working with the source array</em>, right? Well, not entirely.</p>

<p><a href=""http://codepad.org/6n20ooMy"" rel=""noreferrer"">Test case 3</a>:</p>

<pre><code>// Move the array pointer on one to make sure it doesn't affect the loop
var_dump(each($array));

foreach ($array as $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
}

var_dump(each($array));

/* Output
  array(4) {
    [1]=&gt;
    int(1)
    [""value""]=&gt;
    int(1)
    [0]=&gt;
    int(0)
    [""key""]=&gt;
    int(0)
  }
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  bool(false)
*/
</code></pre>

<p>So, despite the fact that we are not working directly with the source array, we are working directly with the source array pointer - the fact that the pointer is at the end of the array at the end of the loop shows this. Except this can't be true - if it was, then <a href=""http://codepad.org/7DIeObk9"" rel=""noreferrer"">test case 1</a> would loop forever.</p>

<p>The PHP manual also states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As foreach relies on the internal array pointer changing it within the loop may lead to unexpected behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, let's find out what that ""unexpected behavior"" is (technically, any behavior is unexpected since I no longer know what to expect).</p>

<p><a href=""http://codepad.org/JJp79xSd"" rel=""noreferrer"">Test case 4</a>:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  each($array);
}

/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://codepad.org/IfwJyTCL"" rel=""noreferrer"">Test case 5</a>:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  reset($array);
}

/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */
</code></pre>

<p>...nothing that unexpected there, in fact it seems to support the ""copy of source"" theory.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>The Question</strong></p>

<p>What is going on here? My C-fu is not good enough for me to able to extract a proper conclusion simply by looking at the PHP source code, I would appreciate it if someone could translate it into English for me.</p>

<p>It seems to me that <code>foreach</code> works with a <em>copy</em> of the array, but sets the array pointer of the source array to the end of the array after the loop.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this correct and the whole story?</li>
<li>If not, what is it really doing?</li>
<li>Is there any situation where using functions that adjust the array pointer (<code>each()</code>, <code>reset()</code> et al.) during a <code>foreach</code> could affect the outcome of the loop?</li>

<ul>
<li><code>npm</code> &amp; <code>bower</code> are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call <code>webpack</code>/<code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> after fetching all the dependencies.</li>
<li><code>bower</code> is like <code>npm</code>, but builds flattened dependencies trees (unlike <code>npm</code> which do it recursively). Meaning <code>npm</code> fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while <code>bower</code> expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes <code>bower</code> and <code>npm</code> are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter on front-end).</li>
<li><code>grunt</code> and <code>gulp</code> are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).</li>
<li><code>grunt</code> vs. <code>gulp</code> (is like <code>maven</code> vs. <code>gradle</code> or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster. </li>
<li><code>webpack</code> (<code>webpack-dev-server</code>) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers. </li>
<li><code>npm</code>/<code>bower</code> + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use <code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> over <code>npm</code> + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. ""on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp"").</li>
<li><code>browserify</code> allows packaging node modules for browsers. <code>browserify</code> vs <code>node</code>'s <code>require</code> is actually <a href=""https://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/"" rel=""noreferrer"">AMD vs CommonJS</a>.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>The memory model means that C++ code
  now has a standardized library to call
  regardless of who made the compiler
  and on what platform it's running.
  There's a standard way to control how
  different threads talk to the
  processor's memory.</p>
  
  <p>""When you are talking about splitting
  [code] across different cores that's
  in the standard, we are talking about
  the memory model. We are going to
  optimize it without breaking the
  following assumptions people are going

</blockquote>

<p>Well, I can <em>memorize</em> this and similar paragraphs available online (as I've had my own memory model since birth :P) and can even post as an answer to questions asked by others, but to be honest, I don't exactly understand this.</p>

<p>I also get this feeling that the C++11 memory model is somehow related to C++11 multi-threading support, as I often see these two together. If it is, how exactly? Why should they be related?</p>

<p>I would also like it so there aren't any extra characters, or parameters in the URL.</p>

<p>How can I achieve this?</p>

<hr>

<p>Based on the answers posted so far, I am currently doing this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form method=""get"" action=""/page2""&gt;
    &lt;button type=""submit""&gt;Continue&lt;/button&gt;

I need to find a solution that doesn't add any characters to the end of the URL.</p>

<p>There are two other solutions to do this: Using JavaScript or styling a link to look like a button.</p>

<p>Using JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button onclick=""window.location.href='/page2'""&gt;Continue&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this obviously requires JavaScript, and for that reason it is less accessible to screen readers. The point of a link is to go to another page. So trying to make a button act like a link is the wrong solution. My suggestion is that you should use a link and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/710089/how-do-i-make-an-html-link-look-like-a-button"">style it to look like a button</a>.</p>

<p>The entire height of the page is filled, and no scrolling is required.</p>

<p>Is there a way to achieve the same effect without using the <code>table</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Elements inside the content <code>div</code> will have heights set to percentages as well. So something at 100% inside the <code>div</code> will fill it to the bottom. As will two elements at 50%.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>For instance, if the header takes up 20% of the screen's height, a table specified at 50% inside <code>#content</code> would take up 40% of the screen space. So far, wrapping the entire thing in a table is the only thing that works.</p>

"8898925","Is there a reason for C#'s reuse of the variable in a foreach?","<p>When using lambda expressions or anonymous methods in C#, we have to be wary of the <em>access to modified closure</em> pitfall. For example:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (var s in strings)
{
   query = query.Where(i =&gt; i.Prop == s); // access to modified closure
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Due to the modified closure, the above code will cause all of the <code>Where</code> clauses on the query to be based on the final value of <code>s</code>.</p>

<p>As explained <a href=""http://resnikb.wordpress.com/2009/06/17/c-lambda-and-foreach-variable/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>, this happens because the <code>s</code> variable declared in <code>foreach</code> loop above is translated like this in the compiler:</p>

<pre><code>string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>instead of like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   string s;
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>As pointed out <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/2388644/120955"">here</a>, there are no performance advantages to declaring a variable outside the loop, and under normal circumstances the only reason I can think of for doing this is if you plan to use the variable outside the scope of the loop:</p>

<pre><code>string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
var finalString = s;
</code></pre>

<p>However variables defined in a <code>foreach</code> loop cannot be used outside the loop:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(string s in strings)
{
}
var finalString = s; // won't work: you're outside the scope.
</code></pre>

<p>So the compiler declares the variable in a way that makes it highly prone to an error that is often difficult to find and debug, while producing no perceivable benefits.</p>

<p>Is there something you can do with <code>foreach</code> loops this way that you couldn't if they were compiled with an inner-scoped variable, or is this just an arbitrary choice that was made before anonymous methods and lambda expressions were available or common, and which hasn't been revised since then?</p>

The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola <strong>'cans'</strong> (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the <em>green rectangle</em> with scale and rotation.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/irQtR.png"" alt=""Template matching""></p>

<p>Some constraints on the project:</p>

<ul>
<li>The background could be very noisy.</li>
<li>The <em>can</em> could have any <em>scale</em> or <em>rotation</em> or even orientation (within reasonable limits).</li>
<li>The image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).</li>
<li>There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the <em>can</em>!</li>
<li>The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely ""too much"" on color detection).</li>
<li>The <em>can</em> could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.</li>
<li>There could be no <em>can</em> at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.</li>
</ul>

<p>So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Byw82.png"" alt=""Total fail""></p>

<p>I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:</p>

<p><strong>Language</strong>: Done in C++ using <a href=""http://opencv.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">OpenCV</a> library.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-processing</strong>: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:</p>

<ol>
<li>Changing color domain from RGB to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV"" rel=""noreferrer"">HSV</a> and filtering based on ""red"" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ktdAB.png"" alt=""Binarized image"">  </li>
<li>Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.</li>
<li>Using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector"" rel=""noreferrer"">Canny Edge Detection Filter</a> to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/F9319.png"" alt=""Contour detection""></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Algorithm</strong>: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0123725380"" rel=""noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> awesome book on feature extraction and called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_Hough_transform"" rel=""noreferrer"">Generalized Hough Transform</a> (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).</li>
<li>It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.</li>
<li>It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will ""learn"".</li>
<li>Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wxrT1.png"" alt=""GHT""></p>

<p>Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong>: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is <strong>extremely slow</strong>! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.</li>
<li>It was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)</li>
<li>Fuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.</li>
<li>In-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you help me improve my <strong>specific</strong> algorithm, using <strong>exclusively OpenCV</strong> features, to resolve the <strong>four specific</strong> issues mentioned?</p>

<p>I hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)</p>

<p>To me, ""unmanaged"" means things like database connections, sockets, window handles, etc.  But, I've seen code where the <code>Dispose()</code> method is implemented to free <em>managed</em> resources, which seems redundant to me, since the garbage collector should take care of that for you.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyCollection : IDisposable
{
    private List&lt;String&gt; _theList = new List&lt;String&gt;();
    private Dictionary&lt;String, Point&gt; _theDict = new Dictionary&lt;String, Point&gt;();

    // Die, clear it up! (free unmanaged resources)
    public void Dispose()
    {
        _theList.clear();
        _theDict.clear();
        _theList = null;
        _theDict = null;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, does this make the garbage collector free memory used by <code>MyCollection</code> any faster than it normally would?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>:  So far people have posted some good examples of using IDisposable to clean up unmanaged resources such as database connections and bitmaps.  But suppose that <code>_theList</code> in the above code contained a million strings, and you wanted to free that memory <em>now</em>, rather than waiting for the garbage collector.  Would the above code accomplish that?</p>

Yesterday I had some changes in my working tree that I had stashed and popped, and then I made more changes to my working tree. I'd like to go back and review yesterday's stashed changes, but <code>git stash pop</code> appears to remove all references to the associated commit.</p>

<p>I know that if I use <code>git stash</code> then <em>.git/refs/stash contains</em> the reference of the commit used to create the stash. And <em>.git/logs/refs/stash contains</em> the whole stash. But those references are gone after <code>git stash pop</code>. I know that the commit is still in my repository somewhere, but I don't know what it was.</p>

<p>Is there an easy way to recover yesterday's stash commit reference?</p>

<p>Then, tens of commits later, I realized the branch is in much better state than the master, so I want the branch to ""become"" the master and disregard the changes on master.</p>

<p>I cannot merge it, because I don't want to keep the changes on master. What should I do?</p>

<p><em>Extra</em>: In this case, the 'old' master has already been <code>push</code>-ed to another repository such as GitHub. How does this change things?</p>

"997482","Does Java support default parameter values?","<p>I came across some Java code that had the following structure:</p>

<pre><code>public MyParameterizedFunction(String param1, int param2)
{
    this(param1, param2, false);
}

public MyParameterizedFunction(String param1, int param2, boolean param3)
{
    //use all three parameters here
}
</code></pre>

<p>I know that in C++ I can assign a parameter a default value.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>void MyParameterizedFunction(String param1, int param2, bool param3=false);
</code></pre>

<p>Does Java support this kind of syntax?  Are there any reasons why this two step syntax is preferable?</p>
